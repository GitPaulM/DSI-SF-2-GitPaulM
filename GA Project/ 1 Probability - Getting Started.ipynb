    "1)  Classical or equally likelihood approach.   In this view, all outcomes are equally likely and the probability was related to the number of events.  For example the probability that the Ace of Hearts is drawn from a random deck of 52 cards is 1/52.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  The frequency approach:  You observe that over the last year 15% of your customers impulse buy a Hershey's candy bar at the counter.   You inference that the probability of a random customer impulse buys a candy bar is 15%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)  The geometric or measure approach.  In this view you measure the the sample space all of the outcomes and compare the outcome size to the overall sample space size or measure.  As an example if you divided a bullseye target into 3 equal parts, say A,B,C, then the probability that someone hits A or B will be (area of A or B) / total area = 2/3.\n",
